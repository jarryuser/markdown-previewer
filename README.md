## Overview

Markdown Previewer is a browser-based editor with a split-pane layout. Write Markdown on the left, see the rendered result on the right in real time. The output matches GitHub's rendering: GFM tables, task lists with custom checkboxes, and syntax-highlighted code blocks.

The project also ships a small CLI (`mdp`) that renders any local `.md` file in the browser with the same styles and live-reloads the page whenever the file is saved

## CLI - `mdp`

`mdp` works in two modes:

- **File mode** - opens a single `.md` file; page live-reloads on every save
- **Directory mode** - opens a directory with a file tree sidebar; click any file to preview it; reloads when the current file changes

Images referenced with relative paths are served automatically

### Install

```bash
# 1. clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/jarryuser/markdown-previewer.git
cd markdown-previewer

# 2. install dependencies
npm install

# 3. build the CLI bundle
npm run build:cli

# 4. register the command globally
npm link
```

### Usage

```bash
# single file
mdp README.md
mdp ~/notes/ideas.md

# entire directory (Obsidian vault, notes folder, etc.)
mdp ~/notes/
mdp ./docs/

# specify a fixed port
mdp README.md --port 3000

# show recent files (numbered list)
mdp

# reopen entry #2 from the recent list
mdp 2

# render to terminal with ANSI colors (stdout, no browser)
mdp README.md -t
mdp README.md --terminal

# interactive TUI: split-pane in the terminal
mdp README.md --tui
mdp ~/notes/ --tui

# pick a color scheme for terminal/TUI output (dark, light, sepia, nord)
mdp README.md -t --theme nord
mdp ~/notes/ --tui --theme sepia
```

The browser opens automatically. Edit files in any editor - the page reloads on each save

In directory mode, press `/` to filter the file tree by name, `j`/`k` to navigate, and `c` to collapse or expand all folders

### TUI mode

`--tui` opens a full-screen terminal interface instead of the browser. The HTTP server still starts in the background, so pressing `b` opens the current file in the browser at any time

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `k` | scroll preview or navigate tree |
| `Tab` | switch focus between tree and preview |
| `l` / `Enter` | open file or expand folder |
| `h` | collapse folder or jump to parent |
| `/` | search files by name |
| `b` | open current file in browser |
| `q` / `Ctrl+C` | quit |

### Uninstall

```bash
npm unlink -g markdown-previewer
```

## Roadmap

### Done

- [x] **CLI viewer** (`mdp`) - opens any `.md` file in the browser with live reload; local images are served from the file's directory
- [x] **Image drag & drop** - drop images onto the editor; inserted as short `local://N` placeholders instead of base64
- [x] **GitHub-style task lists** - custom checkboxes with no bullet points, matching GitHub's rendering
- [x] **Syntax highlighting in the editor** - CodeMirror 6 with Markdown language support and dark/light theme
- [x] **Synchronized scrolling** - Sync button in toolbar keeps editor and preview scroll positions in sync
- [x] **Persist content in localStorage** - content survives page refreshes automatically
- [x] **Word wrap toggle** - Wrap button switches line wrapping on/off; scroll position is restored after layout change
- [x] **Export as HTML** - downloads the rendered preview as a standalone file with all styles embedded
- [x] **Formatting shortcuts** - `Mod+B` bold, `Mod+I` italic, `Mod+K` link, `Mod+Shift+C` inline code; press again to remove
- [x] **Custom export filename** - prompts to edit the filename before downloading
- [x] **Adjustable font size** - A− / A+ buttons; persists in localStorage
- [x] **Fullscreen mode** - Full button expands the app to fill the screen
- [x] **Vim keybindings** - Vim button toggles modal editing with Normal / Insert / Visual modes and status bar
- [x] **Math support** - KaTeX renders `$inline$` and `$$block$$` formulas in the preview
- [x] **Directory mode** - `mdp ./notes/` opens a directory with a file tree sidebar; click any `.md` file to preview; live reload on save
- [x] **Find & replace** - Find button and `Mod+F` open CodeMirror's built-in search and replace panel
- [x] **Table of contents** - TOC button shows a sidebar panel with clickable headings that scroll the preview
- [x] **Mermaid diagrams** - ` ```mermaid ` code blocks are rendered as diagrams via mermaid.js; theme follows light/dark mode
- [x] **`--port` flag** - specify a fixed port: `mdp README.md --port 3000`
- [x] **Recent files** - `mdp` with no arguments shows a numbered list of recently opened files; `mdp 2` reopens entry #2
- [x] **Search in file tree** - press `/` to filter files by name; `↑`/`↓` to navigate results; `Enter` to open; `Escape` to close
- [x] **Wikilinks** - `[[filename]]` and `[[filename|alias]]` links in directory mode navigate between files in the vault
- [x] **Open local file (FSA)** - Open File button loads any `.md` file directly into the editor; page auto-reloads when the file is saved externally; `Mod+S` saves changes back to disk
- [x] **Open local directory (FSA)** - Open Dir button opens a folder using the File System Access API; full file tree sidebar, click any file to preview
- [x] **Back / forward navigation** - browser-style history in the FSA directory overlay; `Alt+←` / `Alt+→` or the arrow buttons navigate between viewed files
- [x] **Resizable sidebar** - drag the handle between sidebar and content to resize; works in both the FSA overlay and CLI directory mode
- [x] **Breadcrumb** - the current file path is shown above the preview in directory mode; each segment is a clickable link

- [x] **TUI mode** (`--tui`) - interactive split-pane in the terminal; file tree on the left, preview on the right; j/k navigation, `/` search, `b` to open in browser; auto-refreshes on file save
- [x] **Image paste from clipboard** - paste images with `Ctrl+V`, stored the same way as drag & drop
- [x] **Print / PDF export** - Print button opens the browser print dialog with print-friendly CSS that hides the editor and keeps only the prose
- [x] **Custom themes** - Light, Dark, Sepia and Nord color schemes; Theme button cycles between them and the choice persists across reloads
- [x] **`--theme` flag** - pick a color scheme for terminal and TUI output: `mdp README.md -t --theme nord`
- [x] **Emoji shortcodes** - turns `:smile:` into 😄 in the preview, GitHub-style
- [x] **Footnotes** - renders footnote syntax (`[^1]`) in the preview

### Planned

**Web editor**

- [ ] **Multiple tabs** - work on several documents at once and switch between them, without relying on the File System Access API
- [ ] **Version history** - automatic content snapshots in localStorage with the option to restore an earlier version
- [ ] **Zen mode** - hides the toolbar and secondary panels, leaving only the editor and preview
- [ ] **Custom preview CSS** - load a user-provided stylesheet to preview the document with different styling
- [ ] **Reading time estimate** - shown next to the word and character counter
- [ ] **Keyboard shortcuts cheatsheet** - an overlay listing every shortcut, similar to `?` in the TUI

**CLI**

- [ ] **Config file** (`.mdprc` / `mdp.config.json`) - default port, theme, directory and other options without repeating flags
- [ ] **Content search** - `mdp --grep "TODO" ./notes/` searches for matches across every `.md` file in a directory
- [ ] **Shell completion** - completion scripts for bash, zsh and fish
